## Usage

Each section of the Prework Study Guide contains notes about certain topics for example HTML, CSS, JAVA Script and GIT. We are able to open the DevTools console and see the JavaScript running. It can be used to look at topics that have been studied in the prework and ultimately it allows us to choose a single project to study first.
